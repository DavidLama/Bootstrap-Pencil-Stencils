# Bootstrap-Pencil-Stencils
**Work in progress**

UI components from the Bootstrap front-end framework as a Pencil stencil collection

See [#1](/../../issues/1) for a full list of included components - requests & contributions welcome!

## Installation
1. Either clone this repo or [download it as a .zip](https://github.com/nathanielw/Bootstrap-Pencil-Stencils/archive/master.zip) and extract the contents
2. Create a .zip of everything **inside** the cloned/extracted folder (not the folder itself)
3. In Pencil, install the .zip via _Tools_ > _Install new collection..._

## Notes
A lot of the elements provide variations which can be accessed by right-clicking on the element once it's on the canvas.
